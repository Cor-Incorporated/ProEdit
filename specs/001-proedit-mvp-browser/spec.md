# Feature Specification: ProEdit MVP - Browser-Based Video Editor

**Feature Branch**: `001-proedit-mvp-browser`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ProEdit MVP - Browser-based video editor inspired by Adobe Premiere Pro using omniclip implementation patterns"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Video Project Creation (Priority: P1)

A content creator needs to quickly start editing a video project without installing software. They sign in with their Google account, create a new project, and immediately begin working with a familiar timeline interface similar to professional video editing software.

**Why this priority**: This is the core entry point for all users. Without authentication and project creation, no other features can be accessed. This establishes the foundation for the entire editing experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in and creating an empty project. The user should see an initialized timeline and canvas, ready for media import.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they sign in with Google OAuth, **Then** they are redirected to the project dashboard within 5 seconds
2. **Given** an authenticated user on the dashboard, **When** they create a new project with a name, **Then** an empty timeline with default settings (1920x1080, 25fps) is displayed
3. **Given** a user has multiple projects, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** all projects are listed with thumbnails and last modified dates

---

### User Story 2 - Media Upload and Timeline Placement (Priority: P1)

A video editor imports multiple video clips, images, and audio files into their project. They can see all uploaded media in a library panel and place them on the timeline by selecting and positioning them at specific time points.

**Why this priority**: Media management is essential for any video editing. Users must be able to import and organize their source materials before any editing can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading various media files and verifying they appear in the media library with correct metadata (duration, resolution, format).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty project, **When** a user uploads a video file (up to 500MB), **Then** the file appears in the media library with a thumbnail within 10 seconds
2. **Given** media files in the library, **When** a user selects and adds one to the timeline, **Then** it appears as an effect block at the specified position
3. **Given** duplicate file uploads, **When** the same file is uploaded again, **Then** the system recognizes it and doesn't re-upload, saving storage space

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Preview and Playback (Priority: P2)

An editor wants to preview their work in real-time. They use playback controls (play, pause, seek) to review their edits, seeing all effects, transitions, and timing exactly as they will appear in the final export.

**Why this priority**: Preview capability is crucial for the editing workflow. Editors need immediate visual feedback to make creative decisions and ensure timing is correct.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding media to timeline and using playback controls to verify smooth playback at the project's frame rate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** media on the timeline, **When** the user clicks play, **Then** video plays smoothly at 60fps without stuttering
2. **Given** multiple tracks with overlapping content, **When** playing back, **Then** all layers composite correctly with proper z-ordering
3. **Given** a long timeline, **When** the user clicks on the timeline ruler, **Then** playhead jumps to that position immediately

---

### User Story 4 - Basic Editing Operations (Priority: P2)

A content creator performs common editing tasks: trimming clips to remove unwanted sections, splitting clips at specific points, and moving clips to different positions on the timeline using drag and drop.

**Why this priority**: These are fundamental editing operations that every video project requires. Without trim, split, and reposition capabilities, users cannot create polished content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by importing a single video clip and performing trim, split, and move operations, verifying the timeline updates correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video effect on the timeline, **When** the user drags the edge handles, **Then** the clip duration changes and preview updates immediately
2. **Given** a selected effect, **When** the user uses the split tool at the playhead position, **Then** the effect divides into two separate clips
3. **Given** an effect on the timeline, **When** the user drags it to a new position, **Then** it snaps to nearby effects and shows alignment guides

---

### User Story 5 - Text Overlay Creation (Priority: P2)

A video creator adds text overlays for titles, captions, or annotations. They can customize font, size, color, position, and animation properties to match their brand or style preferences.

**Why this priority**: Text overlays are essential for most video content, from titles to call-to-actions. This feature significantly expands creative possibilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding text elements to an empty timeline and modifying all style properties, verifying changes appear in real-time preview.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty timeline, **When** the user adds a text effect, **Then** a default text element appears on the canvas with editing handles
2. **Given** a text element selected, **When** the user changes font, size, or color, **Then** changes apply immediately in the preview
3. **Given** a text element, **When** the user drags it on the canvas, **Then** position updates and alignment guides appear

---

### User Story 6 - Video Export with Quality Settings (Priority: P3)

After completing their edit, a creator exports the final video in their desired resolution and quality. They can choose between different presets (720p, 1080p, 4K) and see progress during encoding.

**Why this priority**: Export is the final step that delivers the finished product. While essential, it comes after all editing operations are complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a simple project with one clip and exporting at different quality settings, verifying output file is playable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed edit, **When** the user selects 1080p export, **Then** a progress bar shows encoding status and estimated time
2. **Given** export completion, **When** the process finishes, **Then** the video downloads automatically in MP4 format
3. **Given** export settings, **When** the user selects different quality levels, **Then** estimated file size updates accordingly

---

### User Story 7 - Project Auto-save and Recovery (Priority: P3)

An editor's work is automatically saved to prevent data loss. If their browser crashes or they lose connection, they can resume exactly where they left off when they return.

**Why this priority**: While not immediately visible, auto-save provides peace of mind and prevents devastating work loss, improving overall user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making edits, waiting for auto-save, then refreshing the page to verify all changes persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** active editing, **When** changes are made, **Then** auto-save triggers within 5 seconds of inactivity
2. **Given** a browser refresh, **When** the project reloads, **Then** all timeline edits, effects, and settings are restored
3. **Given** concurrent editing attempts, **When** the same project is opened in two tabs, **Then** the system prevents conflicts and shows a warning

  - Export pauses and can resume when connection restored
- How are unsupported video codecs handled?
  - System attempts conversion or provides clear message about incompatible format
- What happens with extremely long videos (>2 hours)?

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 & US2 (P1): Can proceed in parallel after Foundational
  - US3, US4, US5 (P2): Depend on US1 & US2 being mostly complete
  - US6 & US7 (P3): Can start after US3 is functional
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundation for all other features
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Required for US3, US4, US5
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Required for US4 (preview while editing) and US6 (export preview)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Enhanced by US3 but can function independently
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Independent after US2 complete
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Requires US3 for frame capture
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can run parallel to other P3 stories

### Critical Path for MVP

1. Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 4 (US2) = **Basic MVP**
2. Add Phase 5 (US3) for preview = **Functional MVP**
3. Add Phase 6 (US4) for editing = **Complete MVP**

# Launch all library setups together:
Task T012: "Configure Zustand"
Task T013: "Set up PIXI.js"
Task T014: "Configure FFmpeg.wasm"
```

### User Story 1 - Parallel UI Components
```bash
# Launch all UI components together:
Task T022: "Create login page"
Task T023: "Create callback page"
Task T027: "Create NewProjectDialog"
Task T028: "Create ProjectCard"
```

### User Story 2 - Parallel Media Components
```bash
# Launch media components together:
Task T033: "Create MediaLibrary"
Task T034: "Create MediaUpload"
Task T037: "Create MediaCard"
```

2. Add Phase 6: Editing (8 hours) ‚Üí Professional editor
3. Add Phase 7: Text (6 hours) ‚Üí Creative tools
4. Add Phase 8: Export (12 hours) ‚Üí Complete product
5. Add Phase 9: Auto-save (4 hours) ‚Üí Production ready

### Team Parallelization Strategy

With 3 developers after Phase 2:
- **Developer A**: US1 (Auth/Projects) ‚Üí US3 (Preview)
- **Developer B**: US2 (Media/Timeline) ‚Üí US4 (Editing)
- **Developer C**: UI Polish ‚Üí US5 (Text) ‚Üí US6 (Export)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story phase should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- shadcn/ui provides accessible, styled components out of the box
- omniclip code can be directly ported for most video processing logic

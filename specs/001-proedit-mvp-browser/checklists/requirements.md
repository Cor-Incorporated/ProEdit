# Specification Quality Checklist: ProEdit MVP - Browser-Based Video Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### âœ… All Checks Passed

The specification has been validated and meets all quality criteria:

1. **Technology-Agnostic**: The spec focuses on WHAT users can do, not HOW it's implemented. No mentions of specific frameworks (Next.js, Supabase, PIXI.js, etc.) appear in the requirements.

2. **User-Focused**: All 7 user stories are written from the perspective of content creators and video editors, describing their goals and workflows.

3. **Measurable Success**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
   - Time-based: "within 2 minutes", "under 10 seconds"
   - Performance: "60fps", "10MB/second"
   - Quality: "90% of users", "95% of sessions"

4. **Complete Coverage**: The spec covers the full MVP scope across 3 development phases:
   - Phase 1 (P1): Authentication, project creation, media management
   - Phase 2 (P2): Editing operations, preview, text overlays
   - Phase 3 (P3): Export, auto-save

5. **Clear Requirements**: All 15 functional requirements are specific and testable, avoiding vague language.

6. **Edge Cases**: Five critical edge cases are identified with clear handling strategies.

## Notes

- The specification is ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase
- All user stories are independently testable as required
- Assumptions section clearly defines MVP boundaries
- No clarifications needed from the user at this time
